# syslogalert
Quick and dirty syslog alerts via SMTP. Simple configuration. Golang.

I threw this small tool together while on a two week network rollout
for an event in rural Florida. I needed a quick way to get alerts
on some isolated network hardware without standing up additional
monitoring infrastructure. Nothing fancy here, but it did the trick.
